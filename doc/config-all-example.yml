#  OpenRat configuration file example

#  Per host configuration:
#  A file 'config-<hostname>.yml' is preferred before file 'config.yml'.

#  Rules for reading this file:
#  1. if environment-variable 'OR_CONFIG_FILE' is set, then this value is used for the configuration filename.
#  2. if environment-variable 'OR_CONFIG_DIR' is set, then a file 'config-<hostname>.yml' is read. If it does not exist,  'config.yml' is read instead.
#  3. file 'config/config-<hostname>.yml' is read. If it does not exist,  'config/config.yml' is read instead.
# 


#  Configuration



#  Start other applications out of OpenRat.
#  Other applications are able to authenticate the user with a ticket id (Single Signon)
#  see documentation for more details.

#  The Name of the application
# applications.phpmyadmin.name: PHPYourAdmin

#  URL
# applications.phpmyadmin.url: "https://example.com/anotherapplication/index.cgi"

#  Name of the HTTP-Parameter for the Ticket-Id.
#  OpenRat puts the session-id into this parameter.
# applications.phpmyadmin.param: "ticketidforopenrat"

#  Groups
#  Only User, who are in this group, may see the application
#  (optional)
# applications.phpmyadmin.group: 

#  A brief description of this application.
# applications.phpmyadmin.description: "Your database administration"
# 



cache:
  #  Conditional-GET enables the "304 not modified" HTTP-Header
  #  This is much faster, but sometimes caching is unwanted
  #  if you have caching problems, set this to 'false'.
  #  Default: 'true'
  conditional_get: true



  #  Pages and files are cached in a temporary directory.
  #  'false' means generate each page again and again
  #  'true'  will cache a page's content. This will improve
  #          the performance, but has some side effects,
  #          f.e. no dynamic content will be updated.
  #  Default: 'false'
  enable_cache: false



  #  Directory for temporary files.
  #  Default: blank (means: OpenRat is using the system temporary dir)
  tmp_dir: ''



config:
  #  Auto-Reload session.
  #  If the configuration file is changed, its content is reloaded automatically
  #  Default: true
  auto_reload: true

  #
  #  If the configuration file is changed, a new session will be created.
  #  Default: true
  session_destroy_on_config_reload:  true



content:
  file:
    #  Maximum file size for uploads in KB
    #  Special values: 0,-1 :  not restricted
    #  Default: 0
    max_file_size: 1500




  #  Delete-strategy of old content.

database:
  #  Database configuration.
  #  You have to have at least one database connection which has 'enabled: true'.

  #  Supported connection-types:

  #  - 'postgresql'   Postgresql
  #  - 'sqlite'       SQlite databases

  #  It is useful, to have your own relay host, as servers doing greylisting
